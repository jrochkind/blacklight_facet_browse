  # Create sort keys for indexing, and search keys for starts-with

  # If this logic changed, you'd need to rebuild your index. So
  # this class ends in "V1" with the idea that any future versions
  # will be named differently, and then future verisons of this
  # gem can still support V1 for backwards compat.

  # Uses Unicode collation; defaults to english locale, but you can
  # choose another locale (results may vary, not currently covered
  # by CI).  You can also send in custom pre-processing mappings (todo)
